# ðŸŽ¬ Movie Recommendation System

This project demonstrates how to build a **movie recommendation engine** using a synthetic dataset of 5,000 movies.  
Two approaches are implemented:

1. **Content-based Filtering** â€“ recommends movies similar to a given one using metadata (genres, director, year, etc.)  
2. **Collaborative Filtering (SVD)** â€“ recommends movies to users based on rating patterns (userâ€“movie interactions)
